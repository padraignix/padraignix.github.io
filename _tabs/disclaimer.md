**Effective date: September 8, 2024**

Quantumly Confused ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://quantumlyconfused.com, https://blog.quantumlyconfused.com, and https://padraignix.github.io websites (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We respect your privacy and strive to be transparent about our practices.

1. Hosting Provider
    
    Our blog is hosted by GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service provided by GitHub, Inc. When you access our website, GitHub may automatically collect information related to your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, and the time and date of your visit. This data is collected for operational and security purposes. For more information on how GitHub collects and processes your data, please refer to GitHub’s [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

2. Information We Do Not Collect
    
    We do not collect, use, or store any personally identifiable information (PII) through the use of this blog. Specifically:

    * No cookies: We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies.
    * No analytics: We do not employ third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics or similar services.
    * No personal data collection: We do not collect personal data such as names, email addresses, or location data.

    Any information related to your visit that is collected (e.g., access logs) is handled entirely by GitHub as part of their hosting services.

3. Use of Data
    
    Since no personal data is collected or stored directly by us, we do not process or use personal data for any purpose. Any server-side logs (e.g., IP addresses, access times) that may be generated are handled by GitHub solely for operational purposes, including:

    * Maintaining the availability and security of the site.
    * Diagnosing and fixing server issues.

    For more information on GitHub’s handling of data, please refer to GitHub’s [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

4. Third-Party Services
    
    Our blog may contain links to external websites or services that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third-party’s site. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policies of every site you visit.

    We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

5. Security of Data
    
    We are committed to maintaining the security of our website. However, we do not collect any personal data, and our site relies on GitHub Pages for hosting. While GitHub takes reasonable measures to secure its platform, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure.

    You can read more about GitHub’s security practices in their [Security Overview](https://github.com/security).

6. Links to Other Sites

    Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.

    We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.

7. Children’s Privacy
    
    Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us. Since no personal data is collected, this clause is largely precautionary.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
    
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "effective date" at the top of this page. Any changes will be posted here and will take effect immediately.

    We recommend reviewing this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of any changes. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
