## Lockpicking

Having stumbled on to [/r/lockpicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/) I immediately fell into the addiction. I love that the system was gamified with a series of belts (similar to martial arts rankings) that guides participants on how to challenge themselves in a meaningful manner. I plan on keep track of progress on this page and share any more meaningful or interesting tidbits in dedicated posts. For anyone interested in joining in I suggest perusing the subreddit (specifically [Beltranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/wiki/beltranking)) and the group's Discord which is highly active.
