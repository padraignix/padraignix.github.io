## Lockpicking

Having stumbled on to [/r/lockpicking](https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/) I immediately fell into the addiction. I love that the system was gamified with a series of belts (similar to martial arts rankings) that guides participants on how to challenge themselves in a meaningful manner. I plan on keep track of progress on this page and share any more meaningful or interesting tidbits in dedicated posts. For anyone interested in joining in I suggest perusing the subreddit (specifically [Beltranking](https://www.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/wiki/beltranking)) and the group's Discord which is highly active.

## Cryptopals

Starting off my infosec journey more on the cryptography side I have always wanted to go through and complete the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) series. As both a reinforcement of the basics and expanding my practical knowledge going through the exercises offers the perfect mix of theoretical and hands-on to push my boundaries in the cryptography space. Progress and the coding itself will be stored on [Github](https://github.com/padraignix/cryptopals).

### Progress

* Problem Set 1 - Basics [8/8]
* Problem Set 2 - Block Crypto [2/8]
